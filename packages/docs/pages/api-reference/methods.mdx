# Methods

## clearFeatureCollection

Clears path from the map.

## getFeatureCollection

Returns the current `FeatureCollection` displayed.  
Returns `GeoJSON.FeatureCollection<GeoJSON.Geometry>`

## getLineString

Returns the current `FeatureCollection` concatenated as a LineString. The `properties` key contains `path` and `point` elements that help `Mapbox-gl-path` reconstruct the feature collection.
Returns `Feature<LineString>`

## setFeatureCollection

Parameter: `GeoJSON.FeatureCollection<GeoJSON.Geometry>`

The `featureCollection` includes features that can be of type `Point` or `Linestring`.  
A `Linestring` can be a line between points or a phantom junction line.

## setLineString

Parameter: `GeoJSON.Feature<LineString>`

It draws the lineString on the map.  
If the lineString does not contain `path` and `point` properties to describe how to build a feature collection, `Points` will be automatically added :

- If the first and last points have the same coordinate, the lineString is considered to be looped so one point will be placed at that coordinate and two others will be placed at equal distance from each other.
- Otherwise, two points will be added to the edges.

## setLoopTrail

Draws the path between the last point and the first point only if point count is greater than 3.

## setOneWayTrail

Removes the path between the last point and the first point.
