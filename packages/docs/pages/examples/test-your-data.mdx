# Test your own data online

There are two ways to load data to be displayed: when initializing the map via properties, or afterwards via function calls.  
The easiest way to display data is to fill one of both parameters: `lineString` or `featureCollection`.  
And then you can load another set of data with one of boths methods: `setLineString` or `setFeatureCollection`.

## Example

<TestYourData />

## `lineString`

If the `lineString` is correctly described to fit with _Mapbox-gl-path_ (probably by using `getLineString` _Mapbox-gl-path_ method), all points and paths will be correctly positioned.
If not, an autodermination of `Points` will be drawn.

## `featureCollection`

Your feature collection must contains `lineString` and `Points` (positionned on coordinates matching with `lineString`) data.

<Callout>
  The organization of the file must be strictly well formated. If not, it's
  preferable to use `setLineString` methods to avoid some issues.
