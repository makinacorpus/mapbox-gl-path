# Methods

## clearFeatureCollection

Clears the paths from the map.

## getFeatureCollection

Get the current FeatureCollection drawn.  
Returns `GeoJSON.FeatureCollection<GeoJSON.Geometry>`

## getLineString

Get the current drawn FeatureCollection and concatenates the collection as a LineString. The `properties` contain `path` and `point` elements that helps `Mapbox-gl-path` reconstruct the feature collection.
Returns `Feature<LineString>`

## setFeatureCollection

Parameter: `GeoJSON.FeatureCollection<GeoJSON.Geometry>`

The `featureCollection` includes features that can be of type `Point` or `Linestring`.  
A `Linestring` can be a line between points or a phantom junction line (the latter must have a `isPhantomJunction` properties equals to `true`).

## setLineString

Parameter: `GeoJSON.Feature<LineString>`

It draws the lineString on the map.  
If the lineString does not contains `path` and `point` properties to describe how to build a feature collection, automatic Points will be added :

- If the first and last point have the same coordinate, the lineString is considered to be looped so one point will be placed at that coordinate and two others will be placed at equal distance from each other.
- Otherwise, two points will be added to the edges.

## setLoopTrail

It will draw the path between the last point and the first point only if point count is greater than 3.

## setOneWayTrail

It will remove the path between the last point and the first point.
